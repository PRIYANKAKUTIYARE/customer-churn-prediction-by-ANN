â€¢	Customer Churn Prediction Using ANN				             	                    
o	Developed a Customer Churn Prediction system using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to identify customers likely to leave a service.
o	Utilized customer data such as demographics, usage patterns, and transaction history for feature extraction.
o	Designed an ANN model with input, hidden, and output layers to predict churn probability effectively.
o	Implemented data preprocessing steps, including handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features for optimal performance.
